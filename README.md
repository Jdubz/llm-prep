## Getting Started

Pick the course most relevant to your upcoming interviews:

- **Targeting AI/LLM roles** → Start with [LLMs](courses/llms/) (has a fast-track 8-12 hour option)
- **Frontend/full-stack roles** → Start with [React](courses/react/) + [Node.js & TypeScript](courses/nodejs/)
- **Backend/platform roles** → Start with [Node.js & TypeScript](courses/nodejs/), [Python & FastAPI](courses/python-fastapi/), or [Golang](courses/golang/)
- **Staff+ level interviews** → Start with [Infrastructure & Scaling](courses/infrastructure/) and [General Interview](courses/general-interview/)

Each module contains 3 files:
- **README.md** — Core interview knowledge. Concise, pattern-focused, interview-ready.
- **deep-dive.md** — Extended content. Internals, edge cases, advanced patterns.
- **cheat-sheet.md** — Quick reference card. Scannable during prep or between rounds.
