## Red Flag Answers to Avoid

| Red flag | Why it hurts | Better alternative |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| "I can't think of a failure" | Low self-awareness | Pick a real failure with a real lesson |
| "My coworker was the problem" | Blame-shifting | Focus on what YOU did to resolve it |
| "We just shipped it" | No detail on your contribution | Specify YOUR actions and decisions |
| "It went well" (no metrics) | Unsubstantiated claim | Quantify: revenue, time, users, reliability |
| "I just did what I was told" | No initiative or leadership | Show where you added judgment or went beyond |
| "I worked 80-hour weeks" | Glamorizing unsustainable practices | Focus on smart prioritization, not hours |
| Badmouthing a previous employer | Signals disloyalty | Frame as what you learned and what you want next |
| Revealing confidential details | Breach of trust | Anonymize or generalize sensitive specifics |
| "Anyone could have done it" | False humility, unassessable | Own your contribution while crediting the team |
