## Salary Negotiation Scripts

### When Asked "What Are Your Salary Expectations?"

**Early in the process (recruiter screen):**
> "I'd prefer to focus on whether this is a mutual fit before discussing
> compensation. I'm confident we can find something that works for both of us.
> Could you share the range budgeted for this role?"

**If they push:**
> "I'm looking at total compensation holistically — base, equity, bonus,
> and benefits. Based on my research for this level of role, I'd expect
> total comp in the range of $[top of market + 10-15%], but I'm flexible
> depending on the full package."

**If they insist on a specific number:**
> "Based on my experience and the market data I've reviewed, I'm targeting
> a total compensation of $[high anchor]. That said, the right opportunity
> and team matter more to me than hitting an exact number."

### When You Receive an Offer

**Acknowledging the offer:**
> "Thank you so much for the offer — I'm really excited about this
> opportunity. I'd like to take [3-5 days/a week] to review the full
> details. Could you send me the offer in writing?"

**Negotiating the offer:**
> "I've reviewed the offer and I'm very enthusiastic about joining [Company].
> I do want to discuss the compensation. Based on my research on levels.fyi
> and [competing offer / market data], I was hoping we could bring the
> [equity/base/sign-on] to [$X]. Is there flexibility there?"

**If they say it is final:**
> "I understand. Are there other components we could discuss? For example,
> a sign-on bonus, additional equity, an earlier review cycle, or a
> guaranteed refresher grant?"

**Accepting the offer:**
> "I'm thrilled to accept. Thank you for working with me on the
> compensation. I'm looking forward to starting on [date]. What are the
> next steps?"

## Timeline Management Framework

### Ideal 6-Week Schedule

```
Week 1:  Apply to 5 warm-up companies. Begin phone screens.
Week 2:  Apply to 5-10 target companies. Complete warm-up phone screens.
         Begin technical screens for warm-up companies.
Week 3:  Complete technical screens. Schedule on-sites.
         Phone screens for target companies.
Week 4:  On-sites for warm-up companies. Technical screens for targets.
Week 5:  On-sites for target companies (cluster here).
Week 6:  Receive offers. Negotiate. Decide.
```

### Decision Deadline Management

```
When you receive Offer A:
  1. Thank them. Ask for the offer in writing.
  2. Ask for [X] days/weeks to decide.
  3. Immediately notify all other active companies:
     "I've received a competing offer with a deadline of [date].
      I'm very interested in your role. Can we accelerate?"
  4. Use Offer A as leverage in negotiations with other companies.
  5. Do NOT accept Offer A as a "backup" — only accept what you will honor.
```

### When to Walk Away

Walk away from a company if:
- They refuse to give you reasonable time to decide (less than 1 week)
- The offer is more than 20% below market with no room for negotiation
- The interview experience revealed red flags about culture
- Your gut tells you something is wrong (trust it)
- They pressure you to renege on another accepted offer
