## Red Flags Table

| Answer Pattern | What It Likely Means |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "We move fast and break things" | No quality standards, constant firefighting |
| "We're like a family" | Poor boundaries, guilt-based retention, conflict avoidance |
| "We wear many hats" | Understaffed, unclear roles, scope creep |
| "It's what you make of it" | No structure, overwork normalized, sink-or-swim |
| "We're going through a transition" | Reorg, layoffs, leadership churn, strategic confusion |
| "We just try to fit it in" (re: tech debt) | Tech debt never gets addressed |
| "Product tells us what to build" | Engineering is an order-taking function |
| "The CEO decides" (re: roadmap) | Top-down, founder-driven chaos |
| "We're working on it" (re: any practice) | The practice does not exist today |
| "Everyone is kind of always on-call" | No on-call structure, poor work-life balance |
| "Ask someone who worked on it" (re: docs) | No documentation, bus factor of 1 |
| "We're all very senior" | Difficult to differentiate, potential ego conflicts |
| "I'm not sure" (re: career path) | No growth framework exists |
| "It depends on the person" (re: code review) | Inconsistent standards |
| "We don't really have those" (re: disagreements) | Conflict avoidance or groupthink |
| Defensive response to any question | Touchy topic, likely a real problem |
| Inability to give a specific example | The stated practice is aspirational, not real |
| Inconsistent answers between interviewers | Organizational misalignment |

## Questions to NEVER Ask

### In Any Round

| Question | Why it is bad |
|----------|---------------|
| "What does the company do?" | Shows you did zero research |
| "Will I have to work hard?" | Signals laziness |
| "How quickly can I get promoted?" | Signals entitlement and short-term thinking |
| "Do you check if people are working?" | Signals that you plan to slack off |
| "What is your PTO policy?" | Save for HR / offer stage; in interviews it signals disengagement |
| "Can I work on side projects during work hours?" | Signals split attention |
| "How soon can I transfer to a different team?" | Signals you do not want this role |
| "Did I get the job?" | Puts the interviewer in an awkward position |

### In Technical Rounds

| Question | Why it is bad |
|----------|---------------|
| "What language should I use?" (for coding) | You should have an opinion |
| "Is this going to be hard?" | Shows anxiety rather than confidence |
| "Can I Google things during the interview?" | Depends on company; awkward to ask |

### In Behavioral Rounds

| Question | Why it is bad |
|----------|---------------|
| "Do people actually use the values/principles?" | Cynical tone, even if valid concern |
| "How many people have been fired?" | Aggressive framing |
| "Is the manager micromanaging?" | Accusatory; rephrase as "How does the team handle autonomy?" |

### With Recruiters

| Question | Why it is bad |
|----------|---------------|
| "What's the minimum salary for this role?" | Anchors low |
| "Can I skip some of the interview rounds?" | Entitled |
| "How many other candidates are you considering?" | They will not tell you, and it looks insecure |

## Quick Decision Framework: Which Questions to Ask

```
Step 1: What round is this?
  --> Match questions to the interviewer's role (see above)

Step 2: What do I MOST need to evaluate?
  --> Pick questions that address your top concerns
  --> If you have no concerns, focus on role-specific questions

Step 3: Have any of my prepared questions already been answered?
  --> Cross off anything covered during the interview
  --> Do NOT ask a question that was already answered

Step 4: How much time do I have?
  --> 5 minutes: Ask 2 questions
  --> 10 minutes: Ask 3-4 questions
  --> Always leave time for the interviewer to respond fully

Step 5: Read the room
  --> If rapport is strong, ask a personal question:
      "What do you enjoy most about working here?"
  --> If the interviewer is technical, go deeper:
      "Can you tell me more about the architecture of X?"
  --> If the interviewer seems rushed, ask one strong question
      and keep it concise
