## Negotiation Scripts

### Scenario 1: "What Are Your Salary Expectations?"

> "I would prefer not to anchor on a specific number at this stage. I am more focused on finding the right opportunity and team. Once we have established mutual fit, I am confident we can work out compensation that reflects my experience and the market. Could you share the range you have budgeted for this role?"

**If pressed harder:**

> "Based on my research and experience level, I am looking at total compensation in the range of $X-$Y. But I want to understand the full package — equity, bonus, benefits — before we get into specifics."

### Scenario 2: Countering an Initial Offer

> "Thank you for the offer — I am genuinely excited about this opportunity. After reviewing the details and comparing with my market research, I would like to discuss a few components:
>
> Base salary: I am requesting $[X], which aligns with the market rate for this level in [location] based on data from levels.fyi and other sources.
>
> Equity: Given my experience with [specific relevant skill], I believe a grant of $[X] would better reflect the impact I can make. I have seen comparable grants at peer companies for this level.
>
> Sign-on: I have approximately $[X] in unvested equity at my current employer. A sign-on bonus of $[Y] would help bridge that gap and make the transition straightforward.
>
> I am flexible on how we get there — I am open to shifting between components if that helps."

### Scenario 3: Leveraging a Competing Offer

> "I want to be transparent with you. I have received an offer from [Company] at $[X] total compensation. Your company remains my top choice because of [specific reason]. To make this decision straightforward, I would need the total compensation to be in the range of $[X+10-15%]. Is there flexibility to get closer to that number?"

### Scenario 4: Handling "This Is Our Best Offer"

> "I appreciate you going back to the team. I understand there may be constraints on base salary. Could we explore other areas? For example:
> - An additional equity grant or accelerated refresh schedule
> - A larger sign-on bonus
> - An earlier performance review (at 6 months) with a raise path
> - Additional PTO or remote flexibility
>
> I want to make this work — let us find a creative solution."

## Equity Evaluation Formula

### Public Company RSUs

```
Annual Equity Value = (Shares Granted / Vesting Years) * Current Stock Price

Example:
  Grant: 1,000 shares over 4 years
  Current price: $150/share
  Annual value: 250 * $150 = $37,500/year
```

**Risk adjustment:** Consider stock price volatility. A 20% decline means $30,000/year instead.

### Startup Options

```
Paper Value = (Number of Options) * (Current FMV - Strike Price)

Risk-Adjusted Value = Paper Value
                    * (1 - Illiquidity Discount)    // 30-50%
                    * (1 - Failure Risk)             // 50-90% depending on stage
                    * (1 - Expected Dilution)         // 10-30% per round

Example:
  Options: 50,000
  Strike: $2, FMV: $10
  Paper value: 50,000 * $8 = $400,000
  Risk-adjusted: $400,000 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.8 = $76,800
```

## Timeline Management

### Parallel Process Timeline

```
Week 1-2:   Apply to 10-15 target companies
Week 2-4:   Phone screens and recruiter calls
Week 3-6:   Technical interviews and onsites
Week 5-7:   Receive offers (aim for 2-3 in same window)
Week 7-8:   Negotiate and decide
Week 8-9:   Accept, give notice
Week 10-12: Transition and start
```

### Key Timing Rules

- **Offers are typically valid for 1-2 weeks.** You can usually extend to 3.
- **Ask for extensions early:** "I am in final stages with two other companies and want to make a thoughtful decision. Could I have until [date]?"
- **Give notice promptly** after signing. Two weeks is standard; offer to help transition.
- **Start dates are negotiable.** Taking 2-3 weeks between roles is reasonable.

## Counter-Offer Decision Framework

When your current employer counter-offers:

| Question | Stay Signal | Leave Signal |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Why were you looking? | Purely compensation | Growth, culture, management, boredom |
| Does the counter fix it? | Yes, directly addresses the issue | No, or only partially |
| Trust after resigning? | Strong relationship with manager | Manager or company may retaliate |
| New opportunity unique? | Similar to current role | Offers something unavailable here |
| Counter-offer terms | In writing, specific, immediate | Verbal, vague, "in the next cycle" |
| Historical pattern | Company has honored counters before | Company has a pattern of backtracking |

**Default recommendation:** If you went through the effort of interviewing and receiving an offer, the reasons are likely deeper than money. Leave.
