# Node.js & TypeScript

Expert-level Node.js and TypeScript course for engineers with 10+ years of TypeScript experience. Covers advanced type-level programming, Node.js runtime internals, REST and GraphQL API design, and production architecture patterns.

> **This is your domain.** This course goes deep — not teaching you TypeScript, but sharpening the edges. Advanced type patterns, runtime internals you should be able to explain, API design trade-offs you should have opinions on, and architecture decisions you should be able to defend.

## Content Per Module

Each module directory contains:

- **`README.md`** — Core interview knowledge. Concise, pattern-focused, interview-ready.
- **`deep-dive.md`** — Optional extended content. Internals, edge cases, advanced patterns.
- **`cheat-sheet.md`** — Quick reference card. Syntax, APIs, gotchas — scannable during prep.

## Study Strategy

**Quick prep (6-8 hours)**: Read READMEs for modules 01-04 (your differentiators) + cheat sheets for the rest.

**Deep prep (16-20 hours)**: Work through all READMEs, then deep-dives for areas where you feel shaky.

**During the interview**: Cheat sheets are designed for quick refreshers between rounds.

## Prerequisites
- 10+ years TypeScript experience
- Production Node.js experience
- This course assumes expert-level knowledge and focuses on sharpening, not teaching

## Status
**Content complete** — all modules written.
